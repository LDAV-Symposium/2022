# Keynote

**Image-Based Graph Drawing: From a Million Nodes and Edges to a Million Pixels and Back**<br/>
_Professor Alex Telea, Utrecht University, Netherlands_

Visualizing large, multivariate, and time-dependent graphs is one of the grand challenges of information visualization. In recent years, image-based techniques have emerged as a powerful instrument to handle the visualization of big datasets. Yet, how these techniques, well proven for exploring data in scientific visualization and imaging, can be adapted to handle graph data, is still an open point. In this talk, I aim to provide the missing link between scivis, imaging, and graph visualization. I will explore the characteristics of scivis and imaging data that make it inherently amenable to multiscale visualization approaches, and next outline several directions by which graph data can be brought to the same form, thereby inheriting the desired scalable visualization options. Next, I will propose a taxonomy of multiscale graph visualization methods centered around the image-based approach. Examples will illustrate the added-value of image-based visualization of graphs from several domains. Finally, I will outline the open challenges of image-based methods for visualizing high-variate and time-dependent graphs.

Alexandru C. Telea received his PhD (2000) in Computer Science from the Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands. He was assistant professor in visualization and computer graphics at the same university (until 2007) and then full professor of visualization at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. Since 2019 he is full professor of visual data analytics at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. His interests include high-dimensional visualization, visual analytics, and image-based information visualization. He is the author of the textbook "Data Visualization - Principles and Practice" (CRC Press, 2014).
